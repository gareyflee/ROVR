            <h2>Matthew Dupree</h2>
            <p>A third year Computer Engineering student, Matthew is the most cautious of the group, always concerned
                that some part might take too much current or that the LPC4088 won't be able to handle the amount of
                processing we ask of it. So far, the expertise of his peers has won out, greatly accelerating the pace
                of development without damaging or destroying any parts.</p>
