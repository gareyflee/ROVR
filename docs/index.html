        <h1>Parts Experimentation</h1>
        <p>2018-03-06</p>
        <p>This week was parts interface week. We hooked up our motors through the <a
                href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAAZM4DF5385">L298N Dual H-bridge for
                Arduino</a> package (part number ASMMR in the ECE shop) and provided 5V supply from the lab bench power
            supply, then controlled the H-bridge with a PWM signal. It worked! Unfortunately, only one of our first
            selected GPIO pins worked. After further testing, we discovered that the vast majority of the GPIO pins on
            our LPC4088 developer's kit were not responding, even after we ensured the IO-Configuration Register
            (IOCONN) had been configured to set each of those pins in GPIO output mode. Thankfully, with trial-and-error
            testing, we found six pins that were viable for timer-based GPIO PWM.</p>
        <p>During the trial-and-error testing, we also began to import <a href="#I2C"
                aria-describedby="footnote-label">I<sup>2</sup>C</a> behavior from our lab2 code, for interfacing
            with the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083">Adafruit ADS1015</a> 12-bit multiplexing ADC.</p>
        <p>Finally, we also disabled automatic gain on our <a

                MAX9814</a> microphones and measured their performance on an oscilloscope. We got some good near-sine
            waves with whistling and humming and some good noise from holding consonants; that appeared to be working
            well.</p>

        <h1>Programming weekend</h1>
        <p>2018-03-02</p>
        <p>Our programming group met Saturday this week to go over PWM specs and to test our motors. The motors were
            more powerful than we expected, a pleasant surprise. They also drew a low enough current that we could begin
            considering driving them directly from the LPC4088 pins. Debate as to the safety of such a setup for our
            development board is ongoing.</p>
        <p>This weekend's major challenge came in the form of a tiny FIXME message. Astoundingly, the LPC4088 developer
            board drivers provided for ECE 153B students does not have drivers for the PWM modules. This immediately
            stymied our progress toward writing a simple interface for our particular use case. We sepnt some three
            hours pouring over datasheets and, eventually, located the PWM memory region layout and output pins. While
            based off the standard Timer blocks, the PWM blocks had some subtle differences (like removal of the
            External Capture Register) that made directly adapting the Timer drivers difficult. Currently, our group is
            carefully weighing the interrupt cost of handling PWM through a basic timer block and interrupts, versus the
            development cost of writing our own drivers to use the PWM blocks.</p>

        <h1>Programming begun</h1>
        <p>2018-02-26</p>
        <p>This week, waiting for the parts to arrive, we began to program utility classes and the general program
            structure for the ROVR LPC4088. We also completed deployment of our project website to GitHub Pages. The
            project code and website are published <a href="https://github.com/gareyflee/ROVR">here on GitHub</a> for
            your viewing pleasure.</p>
        <p>We have scheduled an extra lab session for this Saturday, once the parts have arrived, to make more progress
            before the coming week.</p>

        <h1>Parts ordered</h1>
        <p>2018-02-19</p>
        <p>This week, we designed system block diagrams and ordered the additional parts we'll need for the lab. Finding
            an ADC with which we could interface was a significant challenge, as many ADCs within our budget wouldn't
            support signal multiplexing or had an insufficient sampling rate for picking up even deep male voices.</p>
        <p>Using the <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> sound editing software, we tested the
            recoverable signals according to the nyquist rate of the ADCs we considered, eventually settling on the <a
                href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083">Adafruit ADS1015</a>, a 12-bit 4-channel multiplexing ADC
            with programmable gain. We also chose Adafruit for our microphones, taking advantage of the <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-Electret-Microphone-Amplifier-MAX9814/dp/B00SLYAI9K/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1550635698&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=electret+microphone&psc=1&smid=AM0JQO74J587C">Adafruit
                MAX9814</a> for its easy pin access, mountable pcb form-factor, and the ability to disable its automatic
            gain control.</p>
        <p>We also considered motors with reasonable gearing ratios for our project, eventually settling on the <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/Yosoo-Reduction-300RPM-Gearbox-Replacement/dp/B01BBSXDJ4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1550635020&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=yosoo%2Bmini%2Bspeed%2Breduction%2Bmotor&th=1">Yosoo
                Mini DC 6V Speed Reduction Motor</a> for providing 300RPM as its max speed via a built-on gearbox. A low
            base RPM was important, as constructing a new motor gearbox was outside the scope of this project. We also
            decided on a brushed DC motor rather than a stepped motor to simplify the otherwise complex PWM operations
            necessary to provide power to the motor. </p>
        <p>Finally, we identified some H-bridges from our existing parts that could be used to give high-current power
            to the motors while still controlling the motors LPC4088 built-in PWM module.</p>
